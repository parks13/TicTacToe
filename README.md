## About
This is a simple tictactoe game created using Qt.
Worked based on the barebone structure created by Dr. Taiwoo Park @ Seattle Pacific University.

## How to use
Use Qt to run TicTacToe.pro, compile, build, and run it.
Within the running application, first player will be the X and its opponent will be O.
The program will automatically disable user input once the round is over, and you can click reset button at anytime.
